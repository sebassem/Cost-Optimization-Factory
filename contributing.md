Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the cost optimization workbook! Your time and effort is greatly appreciated, no matter how big or small the contribution is.

## ℹ️ Suggesting features and reporting bugs

If you have an idea or notice a bug, [search open issues](../../issues) to see if an issue already exists.

If you find your exact issue, comment on the issue to add more context and vote it up (👍) or down (👎). The more info you can provide, the more likely someone will be able to resolve the issue.

If you don't find your issue, [create a new issue](../../issues/new/choose) per problem or feature request (don't group them together).

## 👩‍💻 Making code changes

If you want to contribute code changes, but aren't sure where to start, scan through [existing issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to find one that interests you. Use `labels` to narrow down your search.

If you find an issue that's assigned to someone, add a comment to check their status – there's a chance they may not have started yet. If you find an issue that isn't assigned, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

When you are opening a PR, make sure to make the change to the respective txt file where all the queries are. For example, if you want to add a new query to the Compute tab, add your query to the [compute.txt](/workbook/modules/Compute/compute.txt)

## 👀 Reviewing code changes

If you want to help out with code, but aren't quite ready to jump in yet, start by reviewing [pull requests](../../pulls). These reviews are just as valuable as sign-off reviews because they help improve the overall quality!

When possible, try to suggest code changes using **Add a suggestion** to streamline the review process.
